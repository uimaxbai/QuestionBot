# QuestionBot
**A bot that can answer questions. (WIP)**

## Visit it now: [click here](https://chatbot-cvqa.onrender.com/)

## Features
- [x] Rotten Tomatoes intergration (ask for a movie name)
- [x] Maths (simple maths, **with spaces in between**, unit conversion)
- [x] Can actually chat (dunno why)
- [x] Google Search for answers (ask a what is question)

## To-do list
- [ ] Write essays?
- [ ] (may never come) Modules
- [ ] More JS and HTML intergration
- [ ] Instant answering
- [ ] CLI interface and PyPI module
- [ ] 'Did you mean...'
### Known Limitations
- Cannot do maths questions without spaces in between (can fallback on Google)
- Sometimes glitches out
- Uses [Render](render.com), a bit laggy at times
- May not be noticable but takes forever to build (not my problem)

## How to use
Either:
| **Visit the website**      | or | **CLI (coming soon)** |
